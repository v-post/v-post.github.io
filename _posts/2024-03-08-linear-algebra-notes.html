<h2>Chapter 1 - Vectors</h2>

<p><i>The following notes are based on the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/">"Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra - Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares" </a> book by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe. 
  It is a very useful resource for people interested in all things Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, as both of those fields are basically various shades of statistics intertwined and built from with various shades of applied mathematics, where linear lagebra plays a dominating role.</i></p>

<h3>1.1 Vectors</h3>

<p>A <span class="term">vector</span> is an ordered finite list of numbers. Usually written as:</p>

<p>
  $$ \begin{bmatrix}-1.1\\0.0\\3.6\\-7.2\end{bmatrix}  \ or \ \begin{pmatrix}-1.1\\0.0\\3.6\\-7.2\end{pmatrix}  \ or \ \begin{bmatrix} -1.1 & 0.0 & 3.6 & -7.2 \end{bmatrix}$$
</p>

<p>A vector consists of <span class="term">elements</span>, also called <i><b>components</b>, <b>entries</b>, or <b>coefficients</b></i>. In the example above, vector elements are -1.1, 0.0, 3.6, and -7.2. 
(<i>As you can see in linear algebra, as well as in Data Science or Machine Learning, which heavily use linear algebra, a lot of things have multiple names, sometimes it gets very confusing.</i>)</p>

<!-- TODO: Should we call ir a scalar? -->
<p>The <span class="term">size</span> of the vector is the number of elements it contains. In the example above, the size of each vector is 4. 
  The vector of size <i><b>n</b></i> is called an <span class="term">n-vector</span>. 
  If n=1, we have a <i><b>1-vector</b></i>, which is considered to be the same as a number<!--(scalar???)-->, meaning that [1.3] is the same as 1.3.</p>

<p>It is convenient to denote vectors with letters, for example a vetor <i><b>a</b></i> .... </p>
