<h2>Chapter 1 - Vectors</h2>

<p><i>The following notes are based on the "Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra - Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares" book by 
  Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe, available freely online <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/">here</a>. 
  It is a very useful resource for people interested in all things Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, as both of those 
  fields are basically various shades of statistics intertwined with and built from various shades of applied mathematics, 
  where linear lagebra plays a dominating role.</i></p>

<h3>1.1 Vectors</h3>

<p>A <span class="term">vector</span> is an ordered finite list of numbers. Usually written as:</p>

<p>
  $$ \begin{bmatrix}-1.1\\0.0\\3.6\\-7.2\end{bmatrix}  \ or \ \begin{pmatrix}-1.1\\0.0\\3.6\\-7.2\end{pmatrix}  \ or \ \begin{bmatrix} -1.1 & 0.0 & 3.6 & -7.2 \end{bmatrix}$$
</p>

<p>A vector consists of <span class="term">elements</span>, also called <i><b>components</b>, <b>entries</b>, or 
  <b>coefficients</b></i>. In the example above, vector elements are -1.1, 0.0, 3.6, and -7.2. 
(<i>As you can notice in Linear Algebra, as well as in Data Science or Machine Learning, which use Linear Algebra heavily, 
  a lot of things have multiple names, sometimes it gets very confusing.</i>)</p>

<p>The <span class="term">size</span>, aka <i><b>dimension</b></i> or <i><b>length</b></i>, of the vector is the number 
  of elements it contains. In the example above, the size of each vector is 4. 
  The vector of size <i><b>n</b></i> is called an <span class="term">n-vector</span>. 
  If n=1, we have a <i><b>1-vector</b></i>, for example [3.6]. It is important to note that the 1-vector [3.6] is not the same 
  as a <i>scalar</i> 3.6, as scalars have only magnitude, but vectors, even the one dimensional ones, 
  have magnitude and direction. However, in linear algebra, 1-vectors are often treated as scalars, while other fields, 
  such as physics, they are never treated as such.</p>

<p>It is convenient to denote vectors with letters and its elements with subscripts, 
  for example a vector <i><b>a</b></i> will have elements \(a_1\), \(a_2\), \(a_3\), etc. We can write an element of 
  vector as \(a_i\), where <i><b>i</b></i> will go from 1 to the size of the vector, <span class="term">n</span>.</p>
